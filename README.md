# 📄 PDF Question Answering App using RAG & Vector DB
### This project enables users to ask any question from a PDF, powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain, Vector DB, and LLMs. The PDF content is indexed and stored in a vector database, enabling smart retrieval and accurate responses to natural language queries.

# 🚀 Features
- 📚 PDF Loader: Upload and process any PDF document.

- 🧠 RAG Pipeline: Combines document retrieval with LLM reasoning.

- 📥 Vector Store: Embeds and stores PDF data for fast semantic search.

- 💬 Ask Anything: Query the PDF content in natural language.

- ⚡ Streamlit Interface (optional) for interactive use.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
- LangChain

- ChromaDB / AstraDB / any Vector Store

- OpenAI / Local LLMs

- Python

- Streamlit (if UI added)

- PDF Loader (e.g. PyMuPDF, PDFMiner)
